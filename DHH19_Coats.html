### European language ecology

- This project investigated bi- and multilingualism among European Twitter users

--

- Who is using what languages on social media? Absence of “reliable, quantitative measurement of online linguistic diversity” (Lee 2016) 

--

- The sample consisted of tweets from Europe-located users who published tweets in more than one language

--

- What patterns of are evident at country-level and language-level?

--

- Can tell us “where languages stand and where they are going in comparison with other languages of the world” (Haugen 1972)

--

- Possibly relevant techniques:

  - Place and language disambiguation
  - Use of Shannon entropy as a diversity measure
  - Choropleth mapping using Leaflet
  - Network analysis, visualization in R using visNetwork 

---

### European language ecology .small[(Coats 2017)]

- Tweets with populated `place` attributes from 55 European countries/territories collected from the Twitter Streaming API November 2016 – June 2017 ("seed" data: 153.2m tweets, 2.9m users)

--

- User timelines downloaded (up to 3250 tweets) for users with at least 100 tweets, of which at least 10 are in a second language, whose `tweet_source` is not a bot, and for whom > 90% of `place` values in the "seed" data and > 50%  in the total data were from one country. 

--

- In total 50,268 unique authors tweets from 2007 to 2017

--

- "Double checking" Twitter's language detection algorithm: Only tweets with > 10 words, required match with `cld2`

### Profanity and gender in the Nordic countries

- Tweets from Greenland, Iceland, Faroes, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Åland, Finland

--

- Profanities in English, Kalaallisut, Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Fininsh

---

### Profanity and gender in the Nordic countries

- Males use more profanity than females, but for English-language profanities, the rates are more similar

--

- Males use more "traditional" profanities (diaboloical invocations such as *fjandinn*, *helvete*, *fandeme*, *jävlar*, *saatana*, *perkele*)

--

- Males use more scatological profanities (*paskaa*, *skit*, *shit*)

--

- Females use more profanities that negatively denote females (*hora*, *tussa*, *druslur*, *bruttan*, *luder*, *kælling*, *ämmä*, *horo*)

--

- Possibly relevant techniques:

  - Word frequency analysis
  - Nordic Genderizer: Data from Nordic statistical offices aggregated for 33k name types, m/f probabilities used to infer Twitter gender from user:name value
  - Word embeddings (word2vec, gensim) and t-SNE

### Skin tone emoji .small[(Coats 2018a)]

Since Unicode 8.0 (June 17, 2015), skin tone characters are part of Unicode

### Emoji sequences

Since Unicode 9.0 (late 2016), emoji sequences can also be used to indicate activities, professions, groups, etc. These can usually be combined with skin tone as well.

--

![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f468.png) + ![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/2695.png) = ![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f468-200d-2695-fe0f.png)

--

![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9db.png) +
![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3ff.png) +
![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/2640.png) =
![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9db-1f3ff-200d-2640-fe0f.png) 

--

Sequences can utilize additional **zero-width joiner** and **variation selector** code points to show that the sequence is to be parsed as one character

![](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9d6-1f3fb-200d-2642-fe0f.png) = \U0001f9d6\U0001f3fb\U0000200d\U00002642\U0000fe0f

--

- Parsing and tokenization of emoji sequences can present difficulties

---

### Skin tone emoji

- Negative correlation between sentiment and darker skin tone

--

- Tweets from much of Asia and the Middle East contain mainly the lightest skin tones

--

- Possibly relevant techniques:

  - Correct Python tokenization of composed emoji 
  - Emoji-based sentiment analysis dictionary (Kralj-Novak et al. 2015)
  - More maps (Leaflet, Google GeoCharts)
  - Emoji embeddings (word2vec, gensim) and t-SNE

### Code-switching and borrowing: German-English

- Get word vectors in a large corpus of tweets with German-English codeswitching

--

- Trace the semantic specialization of borrowed English words in German 

---

### Anglicisms in German .small[(Coats 2018b)]

- Automatically generate potential German verbal anglicisms from a long list of English verbal roots .small[(Davies 2004-, 2008-, 2015; Hanks 2014)]

--

- Get their frequencies

--

Some recent borrowings from English show partial assimilation to standard German orthography: they can retain the -*ed* of the English participle

- .best_studio[liken - geliked/gelikt] .small[(to like - liked)], .best_studio[crashen - gecrashed/gecrasht] .small[(to crash - crashed)], .best_studio[featuren - gefeatured/gefeaturt] .small[(to feature - featured)]

- To what extent are users on social media coining *new* verbal Anglicisms? (i.e. not yet codified as German words or well-established in German use)
